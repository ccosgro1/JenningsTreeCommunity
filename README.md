# JenningsTreeCommunity

This repository contains the data and code for a project evaluating changes in tree communities between 3 forest ecosystems: upland forest, bottomland forest, and riparian forest and their corresponding ecotones between each ecosystem type. 
This property is owned by Kent State University and located in northeast Ohio.

Data contained in this project was collected in 2008 and 2016.

A manuscript for this project is currently in review.
